### Changes to the ESP

Today I was working on my ESP config code and discovered that it can actually run as an access point (AP).  
I'm inclined to use this as a configuration method (a pretty obvious one, to be honest) instead of Bluetooth.  
Why? Because making a debug Bluetooth app was really boring.

So, my new idea is to make a very, very simple web page to configure the ESP, while its regular mode just sends  
data to an endpoint. My current problem is that the program seems to use 70% of the available programming space,  
so I'll need to use some tricks to make it smaller.

### Extra News

Anyway, I also got a new L-shaped table. This gives me more space to work, instead of using my dinner table.  
It's not a full table—just an extra one I had lying around—but I’m planning to get a custom-made one  
to be my workbench.
