Before diving into anything barely practical, we need to start with the basics. The go-to basic embedded project is the blinking LED, but I don't like something so simple. Instead, my first project will be a LED blinking device that uses two buttons to select a power blink level while pressed.

The idea is simple enough for a first thing, but let's see how it works.

The circuit is very simple. Just a button with a pull-down 10k resistor, a led using a 330 resistor. Everything mounted on a cheap protoboard.

The Arduino Uno R3 in the picture is using this driver code to run:

```
Code goes here when I get it from the laptop
```

Simple enough — now let’s see it in action.

And it works!

This was a solid start. I’ll try out a few more beginner-friendly projects before jumping into something more complex.
